ADC with a resolution of 8 bits can encode an analog input to one in 256 different levels (28 = 256). The values can represent the ranges from 0 to 255 (i.e. as unsigned integers) or from âˆ’128 to 127 (i.e. as signed integer), depending on the application. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter
An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to convert an analog signal such as voltage to a digital form so that it can be read and processed by a microcontroller. Most microcontrollers nowadays have built-in ADC converters. our tec-1 with a z80 lacks this. 

ADC0809 is a CMOS process 8-channel, 8-bit successive approximation A / D converter manufactured by National Semiconductor. It has an internal 8-channel multiplexer that can latch the decoded signal based on the address code and only one gate of the eight analog input signals for A / D conversion at a time. Is currently the most widely used 8 general-purpose A / D chip.
