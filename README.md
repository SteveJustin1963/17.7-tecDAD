 ## ADC

 based on input and specific libraries. Make sure you have the appropriate header files for "lcd.h", "ds1307.h", "i2c.h", "delay.h", and "stdutils.h" in your include path. 

Also, ensure the pin assignments and delay functions align with your hardware configuration. 

The code also assumes that the functions for LCD display such as `lcd_Init()`, `lcd_DisplayString()`, `lcd_Line_posnY()`, and `lcd_Clear()` are implemented correctly in your "lcd.h" and corresponding "lcd.c". 

The `delay_us()` and `delay_ms()` functions are assumed to be correctly implemented in your "delay.h" and corresponding "delay.c" as well.
